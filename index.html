      Happy Rose Day, my Strawberry 🌹

If I had to give you a rose, it wouldn’t be the delicate kind that wilts at the first sign of pressure. It would be the kind that grows stubbornly — thorns and all — soft petals wrapped around an unshakeable core. Beautiful, sharp when needed, and impossible to ignore… just like you.

You carry passion and fire, but also care so deeply it sometimes overwhelms you. You love fiercely, think intensely, dream boldly, and still show up — for your writing, your future, and for us. That combination? Rare. Dangerous. Addictive.

I love how you tease with confidence, flirt with intention, boss me around like you own the place, and still let your softer side peek through when you trust. I love how your mind works, how your presence lingers, how even your absence feels loud to me.

So here’s my rose for you — not just for today, but for every day you choose to be exactly who you are.
Strong. Emotional. Brilliant. Mine to admire, and mine to choose… again and again.

🌹
